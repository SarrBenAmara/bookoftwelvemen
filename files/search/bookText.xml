and stepdaughter in her household. She
possessed feelings of hate for
her stepdaughter, Anna.
Anna worked while her
stepsister did nothing.
On a cold January night,
Anna’s stepmother
remarked, “Your stepsister
desires flowers. Go and
find some.”]]></page><page Index="5"><![CDATA[Anna wasn’t anxious to walk
through the chilled landscape. The
cold air made her lungs burn.
She walked at a slow
pace because of the
snow. Soon she
saw a group of
people. It consisted
of twelve men. Anna
told them about
the flowers.]]></page><page Index="6"><![CDATA[One of the man said they were the twelve
months and that they would help Anna.
January walked to her and made
a motion with his hand. The days
of the month passed rapidly
until it was February’s turn.
February also made the
month speed up. Then
March made the sun shine and
flowers grew in the field.]]></page><page Index="7"><![CDATA[Anna loaded her basket with so many flowers
that she could hardly lift it. Then she gave a
quick but polite “ thank you” to the
twelve men and returned home.
She was very eager to show her
stepmother all the flowers. Back
at the house, she spilled the
flowers onto the table. Then she
told her stepmother about
the twelve men.]]></page><page Index="8"><![CDATA[Anna’s stepmother and stepsister went to
seek the twelve months. Their
intent was to ask for gifts.
They looked and looked. They
became very lost and never
found their way home. Anna lived
happily by herself.]]></page><page Index="9"><![CDATA[What about checking your understanding?
